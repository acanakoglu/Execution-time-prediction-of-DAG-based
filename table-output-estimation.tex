%scientific data-driven workflow: done

% DAG execution time / Workflow execution time:done

% include section response time in  se section  3A: done
% move the related work later on: done
% move application description before: done
% Make clear what is the performance of Ernest (for us black-box full): stated that Ernest accuracy is comparable tot hte acuracy of bb composite features
% make clear that we are showing scaling of the prediction: done?
% final plots showing errors 

% extrapoolation


% stress that workflow execution is all validation
% training on basic queries we are able to predict completely different queries (more complex / composition of basic) - external - at the end of the introduction (training and validation on totally different queries)
